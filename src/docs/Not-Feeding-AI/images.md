# Images

If you upload an image to a website or social medial platform, it might be used to train AI. This might be done without your consent and in contravention of the law.

The Glaze Project provides "...tools that artists can use to disrupt unauthorized AI training on their work...". They have two main tools:

* [Glaze](https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/): Attepts to modify your images so that AI can't be trained to copy your artistic style.
* [Nightshade](https://nightshade.cs.uchicago.edu/): Attempts to modify your images so if they're used to train AI, they'll "poison" that AI: meaning they'll negatively affect the images generated by the AI.

You can control how much your images are modified.
