# Firefox

The web browser from the [Mozilla Foundation](https://www.mozillafoundation.org/).

Mozilla's approach to AI features is ["You decide when, how or whether to use it at all."](https://blog.mozilla.org/en/firefox/ai-window/)

## Removing the AI chatbot shortcut from the sidebar

The sidebar provides shortcuts to things like bookmarks and your browsing history. To remove the AI chatbot from the sidebar, complete the following steps:

1. Select the gear icon in the lower-left corner of the Firefox window.
2. In the **Customize sidebar** panel, turn off the **AI chatbot** checkbox.
3. Close the **Customize sidebar** panel.

## Other AI features

Other AI features are available, but they're currentely turned off by default.

## Firefox without AI

Because Firefox is open source software, people can create their own, altered versions. One of these versions is [Waterfox](https://www.waterfox.com/). In a recent blog post, it was announced that [Waterfox would not include the majority of Firefox's AI features](https://www.waterfox.com/blog/no-ai-here-response-to-mozilla/), and never include large language models (LLMs). If you want a browser that has a similar browsing experience to Firefox, and many of the same featuers, but without AI, you could try Waterfox.
