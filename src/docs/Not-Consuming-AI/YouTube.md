# YouTube

The video streaming site owned by Google. The site provides a variety of [AI tools](https://blog.youtube/inside-youtube/2024-in-youtube-ai/) and reports that [92% of their creators are using generative AI tools](https://www.youtube.com/intl/ALL_in/howyoutubeworks/ai/). The site is also allegedly [applying AI filtering to uploaded videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=86nhP8tvbLY) without the creators' explicit consent.

## Searching for videos uploaded before 2023

You can use the standard strategy of searching for videos that were uploaded before generative AI was widely used.

* When you perform a search, include *before:2023-01-01* in the search field.


## Subscribing

You've likely been asked to "like and subscribe" when watching videos on YouTube, but as well as helping the creators, it can help you avoid AI. If you subscribe only to channels that you trust to not use AI generated content, you can go to [https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions](https://www.youtube.com/feed/subscriptions) to see only their videos.


## Altered content

When someone uploads a video, they can mark it as including [Altered Content](https://blog.youtube/news-and-events/disclosing-ai-generated-content/). This is essentially useless for the following reasons:

* It only applies if "...content is altered or synthetic and seems real". So shrimp Jesus, or other obviously fake content probably wouldn't need to be flagged.
* There isn't any way to filter out videos marked in this way. The only indication is a [label added to the video's description](https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/14328491?hl=en#after_disclose).
* The person that uploads a video has to voluntarily select the checkbox.
