# X (aka Twitter)

Grok is the AI service from X, which famously referred to itself as [MechHitler](https://www.npr.org/2025/07/09/nx-s1-5462609/grok-elon-musk-antisemitic-racist-content). To mute Grok so that you don't see its posts, complete the following steps:

1. Go to [https://x.com/grok](https://x.com/grok).
2. Select the three dots (elipses) button, and then select **Mute** from the menu that appears.
