# X (aka Twitter)

## Preventing others from editing your images

On December 24, 2025, X added AI image editing for public posts. Anyone with an X account can use AI to edit any other user's images.

* To prevent other users from being able to edit your images with AI, save them in the gif format before you upload them. Most image editors are able to save images as gifs, such as Microsoft Paint. Typically, you select **File** > **Save as**, and then choose the gif image format.

    X could allow users to edit gif images in a future update.
