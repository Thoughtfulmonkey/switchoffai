# Steam

The game marketplace and distribution platform used by both indie developers and large publishers.

## Using SteamDB to avoid AI

Steam requires publishers to label games that include AI generated content, and to explain how AI was used. This disclosure is shown in the game's description on its Steam store page.

However, you can't use the AI content disclosure to filter games on the Steam site. For that, you'll need to use an independent cataloging site: SteamDB.

1. Go to [https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/](https://steamdb.info/instantsearch/).
2. In the **Search tags** field, enter *ai*.
3. Hover over the **AI Content Disclosed** tag, and then select **exclude**.
