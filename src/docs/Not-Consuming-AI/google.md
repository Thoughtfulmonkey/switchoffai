# Google search

AI summaries might appear on the search results page.

# Using the -AI search term

The easiest way to both remove AI summaries on the search results page and AI results is as follows:

* Include *-AI* in your search.

For example, *country with the longest border -AI*.

# Filtering to websites only

By filtering the search results to just websites, you can remove the AI summaries. This also removes other widgets, like **People also ask**, as well as video and image suggestions. To apply the filter, do the following:

* Add *&udm=14* to the end of the address after you perform a search. For example, *https://www.google.com/search?q=country+with+the+longest+border&udm=14*.

To make search more convenient, you can use [udm14.org](https://udm14.org/). If you perform a search there, it redirects you to a Google search with the udm filter applied.
