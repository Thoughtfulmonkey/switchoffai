## Turning off generative AI suggestions

Follow these steps to see less generative AI recommendations:

1. Go to [https://pinterest.com/edit/gen-ai-interests](https://pinterest.com/edit/gen-ai-interests).
2. Turn off all of the categories for which you don't want to see generative AI recommendations.

If you can't use the previous steps to go directly to the GenAI interests page, complete the following steps instead:

2. Select the gear icon (**Settings & Support**) in the lower-left corner of the page.
3. Select **Settings** from the menu that appears.
4. Select **Refine your recommendations**.
5. Select the **GenAI interests** tab.
6. Turn off all of the categories for which you don't want to see generative AI recommendations.
