# Switch off AI

If you don't want to use AI, you should be able to switch it off.

Over the past few years, many technology companies have added artificial intelligence (AI) features to their products, and they're very keen for you to use them. But if you don't want to use them, you might find instructions on this site that show you how to switch them off.

This site can't cover every product or service available, or keep up with the current rate at which AI features are being added. If you're looking for something that isn't listed here, don't give up. You can search somewhere else or contact the product or service's support.

If want to switch off AI in a product or service and it won't let you, your choice is then whether or not to continue using that product or service. There are always alternatives. Just check that the alternative provides more end user choice before you make the switch.

## What do we mean by AI?

This site specifically relates to generative AI that produces text, images, audio, or video. These are AI services that were trained on large amounts of example content, and then reconstruct an amalgamated output in response to a prompt. For example, if someone asks for a picture of a cat wearing a clown hat, as long as the example content included pictures of cats, clown hats, and creatures wearing hats, the service can create an amalgamation that matches the prompt.

The field of AI includes a much broader range of technologies that have been in use for decades, and many products that are now marketed as AI weren't considered AI a few years ago.
