## Searching before 2023

Generative AI content began to emerge around 2022 to 2023. If you use a search that includes a date filter, you can restrict the search to before 2023 to filter out almost all the correctly classified AI content.

This is a drastic option, because you'll exclude all of the latest information. However, if the thing you're searching for existed before 2023, you might still find the result you need.
